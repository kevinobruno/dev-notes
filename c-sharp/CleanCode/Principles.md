# Principles

**DRY**, **YAGNI** and **KISS** are powerful alone, but better together. By applying them in your product development process you will:

1. Get a product with a better user experience.
2. Increase the efficiency of the development team in the short and long term.
3. Create a simple, maintainable, and flexible codebase.
4. Avoid legacy code where possible.
5. Optimize the cost of developing new features and system maintenance.
6. Enable your developers to improve their ways of working and communication, which at the end of the day, will increase product quality and employee satisfaction.

These product design principles are sets of guidelines that have proven effective over the years. They are widely known among experienced developers, solution architects, and product designers, but for some reason, they rarely make it to business decision-makers. And that’s a missed opportunity.

## DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)

**DRY** stands for `Don't Repeat Yourself` and recommends reducing the repetition of software patterns. By eliminating redundancies in process and logic, engineers lower technical debt and improve the maintainability of the code - both of which are important cost factors, especially in the long term. What’s important, DRY should be applied across the whole system, including not only in the codebase but also in testing and documentation.

The **DRY** principle states that Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system (the quote comes from the book “The Pragmatic Programmer” written by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas). It requires programmers to use abstraction to remove characteristics, in order to be able to reuse an element in different parts of the application.

The **DRY** principle ensures that any modification of a single element of a system does not require a change in other, logically unrelated elements. So it’s an effective way of streamlining the development process. In addition, elements that are logically related change predictably and uniformly, which keeps them in sync.

## YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)

The `You Aren’t Gonna Need It` principle comes from Extreme Programming. It requires software developers to work on functionalities when they’re actually needed, not when they assume or foresee that something might be useful in the future. The YAGNI principle is also important when implementing Agile, as the framework states that the development team should focus only on the current iteration in order to deliver the agreed scope in time.

The main goal of the **YAGNI** principle is to avoid spending time and money on overengineering things that you think you will need later on. Because in the end, it usually turns out that you don’t need it, or that what you need is different from what you expected.

The primary benefit of using **YAGNI** is a more cost-optimized product development process due to:

1. Better developer performance: The team focuses on delivering the current requirements effectively. They don’t spend time and effort on guesses.
2. More flexible codebase: You don’t have to find ways to use suboptimal solutions that you had already developed before you had the full picture.

## KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid!)

According to the `Keep It Simple, Stupid!` principle the key to building a successful product is simplicity. The **KISS** method applies to the design and development of digital products, but it’s also widely used in other fields, such as management or engineering.

It was actually first noted in the U.S. Navy in 1960. And the idea that it’s generally more effective to keep things simple rather than complex, is much older. It’s probably safe to say that minimalism doesn’t have one founding father or mother, so let’s take this quote from Leonardo da Vinci as an example: Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.

**KISS** is also used as an acronym for keep it short and simple, keep it short and sweet and keep it simple and straightforward. However, all these variations refer to the same approach.

In the digital product development context, the keep it simple, stupid principle has a huge impact on overall product success:

1. Users don’t want to waste time. They expect a frictionless experience with straightforward, intuitive user flows, jargon-free naming, and quick results.
2. A simpler software structure makes testing, including also automated testing, easier and more effective.
3. Reduced codebase complexity makes maintenance and onboarding of new team members mid-project easier and faster.
